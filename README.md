## Getting Started - For Claude Desktop

### Claude Setup
1. Install Claude Desktop
2. Run `mcp install ScoutTeam.py` in your terminal
3. Check for the tool config at `Claude > Settings > Developer > Edit Config`
4. If not automatically added, manually add this configuration:
   
   ```json
   "ScoutTeam": {
      "command": "/Users/username/.local/bin/uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "/PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIR/ScoutTeamMCP/",
      ]
    }
   ```
   
   Notes:
   - Find path to uv - for MacOS: run `which uv`, for Windows run `where uv`
   - Replace `/PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIR/ScoutTeamMCP/` with the actual path to your project
   - Replace `username` with your actual username

6. Restart Claude after making these changes

If everything is correct, you should be able to see the ScoutTeamMCP tool here in Claude Desktop.
